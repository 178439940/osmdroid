TBD - This bit is complicated.

The 3 class files in this project were lifted from osmbonuspack and heavily modified, which is an LGPL project.

Osmbonuspack lifted the files from http://www.salidasoftware.com/how-to-render-mapsforge-tiles-in-osmdroid/ who doesn't have a license defined.

Direct email correspondence from the original author dated 17 Jan 2016, said that we can do whatever we want with it.

Therefore, the class files provided by osmdroid are covered about the ASF 2.0 License.

Mapsforge is an LGPL project.
